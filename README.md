# ShellKeeper

ShellKeeper is a CLI tool for managing and storing useful shell commands. It allows users to add, delete, list, and search for stored commands.

## Installation

You can install ShellKeeper using `pipx`.

### Install with `pipx`

`pipx` is a tool to help you install and run Python applications in isolated environments. It's a great way to install ShellKeeper without affecting your system's Python environment.

To install ShellKeeper globally with `pipx`, use the following command:

```bash
pipx install .
```

## Running the Project

```
